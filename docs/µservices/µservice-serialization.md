# Âµservice serialization

## Why serialization?

Serialization is a way to convert data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

## How to serialize?

There are several ways to serialize data. The most common are:

* Text format 
  * JSON
  * XML
  * YAML

* Binary format
  * Protocol Buffers
  * Thrift
  * Avro
