# K8S

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

I will try to give explanation for different Docker installation (help appreciated) !

Right now I will only give instruction for Orbstack my ❤️ favorite by far.

## Orbstack

Orbstack is a Kubernetes distribution that is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It is based on the upstream Kubernetes project and is designed to be compatible with the Kubernetes ecosystem.


[Setup with orbstack](./k8s/k8s-orbstack.md) is really easy, enjoy it !
